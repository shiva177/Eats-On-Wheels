## Eats-On-Wheels (MERN Stack)

**Project Overview:**
Eats-On-Wheels is a web-based food delivery platform powered by the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Our app enables users to discover nearby restaurants, place orders with ease, create personalized profiles, and make secure payments. Experience the convenience of delicious meals delivered right to your doorstep with EatsOnWheels.

**Key Features:**
- Browse and search for restaurants and dishes.
- User authentication and profile management.
- Real-time order tracking with interactive maps.
- Secure payment processing through [Payment Gateway].
- Admin dashboard for restaurant owners to manage their listings.
- Order history and ratings and reviews system.

**Technologies Used:**
- Front-end: React.js, Redux for state management, Bootstrap for responsive design.
- Back-end: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB for data storage.
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Payment Integration: Stripe for secure payment processing.
- Deployment: Front-end on Vercel, back-end on Render.

**Purpose:**
This project was created as both a learning experience and a practical solution for ordering food online. It showcases my proficiency in full-stack development using the MERN stack.

**Learning Goals:**
During the development of this app, I aimed to:
- Master the MERN stack and RESTful API design.
- Implement real-time features for order tracking.
- Gain experience with user authentication and secure payment processing.
