## Food Delivery App (MERN Stack)

**Project Overview:**
This is a web-based food delivery application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The app allows users to browse nearby restaurants, place orders, track deliveries in real-time, create user profiles, and make secure payments.

**Key Features:**
- Browse and search for restaurants and dishes.
- User authentication and profile management.
- Real-time order tracking with interactive maps.
- Secure payment processing through [Payment Gateway].
- Admin dashboard for restaurant owners to manage their listings.
- Order history and ratings and reviews system.

**Technologies Used:**
- Front-end: React.js, Redux for state management, Bootstrap for responsive design.
- Back-end: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB for data storage.
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Payment Integration: Stripe for secure payment processing.
- Deployment: Front-end on Vercel, back-end on Render.

**Purpose:**
This project was created as both a learning experience and a practical solution for ordering food online. It showcases my proficiency in full-stack development using the MERN stack.

**Learning Goals:**
During the development of this app, I aimed to:
- Master the MERN stack and RESTful API design.
- Implement real-time features for order tracking.
- Gain experience with user authentication and secure payment processing.
